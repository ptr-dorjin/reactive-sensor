= Fully Reactive sample project

This is a sample project that uses fully reactive approach. The project consists of 3 parts:

- `reactive-server` is a microservice that
    * receives an inbound stream of sensor data from IoT devices (see `reactive-device`)
    * sends an outbound steam of the sensor data to other clients (see `reactive-web`)
- `reactive-device` is a mini-module that emulates an IoT device and sends data to the server
- `reactive-web` is a web app that consumes data from the server and displays it on UI


Frameworks/technologies used:

- Spring Boot
- Spring WebFlux with Netty and Project Reactor under the hood
- Persistence: Spring Data R2DBC via r2dbc H2 driver *
- Protocol: RSocket via WebSockets
- Kotlin coroutines
- Gradle

NOTE: * for sensors data, one of NoSQL DBs is more suitable, but I'd like to use R2DBC in this project
