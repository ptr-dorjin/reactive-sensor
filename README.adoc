= Fully Reactive sample project

This is sample microservice that receives incoming sensor data streamed from IoT devices. The microservice can also stream this data out to its clients via exposed API.

Implemented with:

- Spring Boot
- Persistence: Spring Data R2DBC via r2dbc postgres driver *
- Web: Spring WebFlux with Netty and Project Reactor under the hood
- Protocol: RSocket via WebSockets
- Kotlin coroutines

NOTE: for sensors data, NoSQL DB is more suitable, but I'd like to use R2DBC in this project
