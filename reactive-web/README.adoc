= reactive-web

`reactive-web` streams data from `reactive-server` using RSocket over WebSockets and displays the sensor data in a chart

It's implemented using:

- create-react-app
- React for UI
- Typescript as a source code language
- RSocket Websocket JS client library
- Chart.js
- Yarn

== Build

. Install npm and yarn globally, if not yet

    sudo apt install npm
    sudo npm install -g yarn

. Build

    yarn build

== Run locally

    yarn start

Then open http://localhost:3000

== Notes

I tried to use `RSocketResumableTransport` instead of low level `RSocketWebSocketClient`, but it's not that easy to make it work. This means that if the `reactive-server` gets restarted, then you have to refresh the browser page manually.
