= reactive-server

This is a backend part of this project.

- `reactive-server` module is a microservice that streams data in and out from 2 kind of clients:
* an inbound stream of sensor data from IoT devices (see `reactive-device`)
* an outbound steam of the sensor data to other clients (see `reactive-web`)
* a client can be a combination of both, but not necessarily.

Implemented with:

- Spring Boot
- Spring WebFlux with Netty and Project Reactor under the hood
- Persistence: Spring Data R2DBC via r2dbc H2 driver *
- Protocol: RSocket via WebSockets
- Kotlin coroutines
- Spring Actuator

NOTE: for sensors data, one of NoSQL DBs is more suitable, but I'd like to use R2DBC in this project


== Spring Actuator

This module exposes an Actuator endpoint: http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/sensor.inbound.count
