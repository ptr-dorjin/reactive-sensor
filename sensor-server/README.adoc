= Fully Reactive sample project

This is a sample microservice that receives incoming sensor data streamed from IoT devices. The microservice can also stream this data out to its clients via exposed API.

Implemented with:

- Spring Boot
- Persistence: Spring Data R2DBC via r2dbc H2 driver *
- Web: Spring WebFlux with Netty and Project Reactor under the hood
- Protocol: RSocket via WebSockets
- Kotlin coroutines

NOTE: for sensors data, one of NoSQL DBs is more suitable, but I'd like to use R2DBC in this project
