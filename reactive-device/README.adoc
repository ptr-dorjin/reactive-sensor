= reactive-device

This is an IoT device part of this project.

`reactive-device` module emulates a device.
It's a simple app that sends a sensor data to `reactive-server` every N seconds.

Implemented with:

- Spring Boot
- Protocol: RSocket via WebSockets
- Kotlin coroutines

== Configuration

Env. variables:

- `SENSOR_SERVER_HOST` is the host of `reactive-server`.
Default is localhost.
- `SENSOR_SERVER_PORT` is the port of `reactive-server`.
Default is 7000.
- `SENSOR_DEVICE_NAME` is the name of this device.
Make them different for each deployed `reactive-device`.
Default is "device-$randomInteger".
- `SENSOR_DEVICE_INTERVAL` is the interval in millis in which this `reactive-device` sends data to `reactive-server`.
Default is 5000.

== Run on local machine

    java -jar build/libs/reactive-device-VERSION.jar

It is safe to deploy several instances of `reactive-device` on one host.

== Run in Docker container

see `docker-compose.yml` in the parent directory
